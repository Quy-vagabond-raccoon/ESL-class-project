        <h1>Welcome to Vietnam</h1>
        <h2>Hello everyone, my name is Quy, I'm from Ho Chi Minh city which is the South of Vietnam. There are a lot of things I can tell you about, like how Vietnamese loves foreigner and how the food fascinates chef Gordon Ramsay. Although we have a mixed culture from Chinese, French and America, we do have our uniqueness. I hope you guys enjoy my page <i class="material-icons">favorite</i></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Ho Chi Minh city has another name is Saigon which is the largest city in Vietnam. There are many things you can do in my city. If you're history lover, you should visit War museum, Ho Chi Minh museum, but I will let you know that these museums are pretty sad, because my country had many wars before we got freedom in 1975. Moreover, Vietnam has delicious coffee and tea, this is a great gift you should buy for you and your family. Also, if you're a food-holic like me, I recommend you try authentic Pho, fried spring rolls, and don't forget street food! For more information, please visit this page. <a href="http://www.vietnam-guide.com/ho-chi-minh-city/" target="_blank">Ho Chi Minh City guide</a>. <br>Don't forget to watch the video! It makes me miss my country so bad :( </li><br>
