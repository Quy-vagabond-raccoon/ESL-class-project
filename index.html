        <h2>Hello everyone, my name is Quy, I'm from Ho Chi Minh city which is the South of Vietnam. There are a lot of things I can tell you about, like how Vietnamese loves foreigner and how the food fascinates chef Gordon Ramsay. Although we have a mixed culture from Chinese, French and America, we do have our uniqueness. I hope you guys enjoy my page <i class="material-icons">favorite</i></h2>
      <ul>
         <li>Ho Chi Minh city has another name is Saigon which is the largest city in Vietnam. There are many things you can do in my city. If you're history lover, you should visit War museum, Ho Chi Minh museum, but I will let you know that these museums are pretty sad, because my country had many wars before we got freedom in 1975. Moreover, Vietnam has delicious coffee, tea and cashews nut; this is a great gift for you and your family. Also, if you're a food-holic like me, I recommend you try authentic Pho, fried spring rolls, banh xeo and don't forget street food!

          <li> Vietnam people has a huge love for soccer and beer. Everytime Vietnam soccer team wins, we always celebrate big and drink a lot of beers! Vietnamese people drives motorbike everywhere and you will feel overwhelmed when you try to cross the street. Most of Vietnamese people likes to go to local marker to buy fresh foods than go to supermarket. We also eat rice on every meals, eat a lot of fruits and vegetables that's why Vietnamese has a small and slender body type.
