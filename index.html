        <h1>Welcome to Vietnam</h1>
        <h2>Hello everyone, thank you for reading my website. My name is Quy, I'm from Ho Chi Minh city which is the South of Vietnam. My country has 54 ethnics so there are many different languages but the most popular language is Vietnamese. My city is an entertainment city, which is popolar with a lot of restaurants, shopping malls, big museums and so on. I hope you guys enjoy my page <i class="material-icons">favorite</i></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Ho Chi Minh city has another name is Saigon which is the largest city in Vietnam. There are many things you can do in my city. If you're history lover, you should visit War museum, Ho Chi Minh museum, but I will let you know that these museums are pretty sad, because my country had many wars before we got freedom in 1975. Moreover, Vietnam has delicious coffee and tea, this is a great gift you should buy for you and your family. Also, if you're a food-holic like me, I recommend you try authentic Pho, fried spring rolls, and don't forget street food! This is my city view at night. For more information, please visit this page. <a href="http://www.vietnam-guide.com/ho-chi-minh-city/" target="_blank">Ho Chi Minh City guide</a>. <br>Don't forget to watch the video! It makes me miss my country so bad :( </li><br>
